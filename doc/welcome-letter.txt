subject: welcome to Ghini/Bauble!

Dear new user,

welcome to Ghini/Bauble!

I've received your registration for bauble.classic/ghini.desktop, many thanks for taking your time to fill in the form and to send it to the registration server.

I see you are using bauble.classic-1.0.55. 1.0.55 is the last released version for bauble.classic, however, bauble.classic is now unmaintained and superseded by the totally compatible but slightly aesthetically different ghini.desktop. To update your software to the latest release, you need to install ghini, following the instructions at http://ghini.rtfd.org

The registration service says you're not yet using the newest Python version available. As of 2016-06-25, that would be 2.7.12. Using any older version does not necessarily need be a problem, but in case anything strange happens please first update your Python (and PyGTK) before reporting any errors.

We hope you will enable the "sentry" errors and warnings handler. With that enabled, Ghini/Bauble will send any error or warning you might encounter to a central server, where a developer will be able to examine it. If the warning was caused by an error in the software, we will try to solve it and include the solution in a subsequent release of the software. To enable the sentry handler, open the ":config" page in Ghini and double click on the row "bauble.use_sentry_client".

Ghini's development is mostly community based. I hope Ghini already matches your expectations, and in case it does not or not completely, myself and the whole ghini community will be very thankful if you would take your time to report about your experience with it.

The above is one way to contribute to ghini's development. Others are:
- contribute ideas, writing on the bauble google forum (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bauble)
- give private feedback, writing to ghini@anche.no
- publicly praise ghini and promote its adoption by other institutions
- open an issue on github (https://github.com/Ghini/ghini.desktop/issues/)
- contribute code (fork the project on github)
- hire a developer and have a set of github issues solved, if you need them quickly.
- let me include your garden on our (still experimental) map: gardens.ghini.me

I sincerely hope you will enjoy using the software I maintain

Best regards,
Mario Frasca
