Who is behind Bauble
..............................................

Bauble started as a one-man project, by Brett Adams. He wrote Bauble for the
Belize Botanical Garden, and later on adapted it for a couple of other users
who asked him to use it. Brett made Bauble a commons, by releasing it under
a GPL license.

After some years of stagnation Mario Frasca took responsibility of updating
Bauble, and it is now Mario Frasca writing this, enhancing the software,
looking for users, requesting feedback...

So currently behind Bauble there's again one developer, but much more
importantly, a small but growing global users community.

Translations are provided by volunteers who mostly stay behind the scenes,
translating a couple of missing terms or sentences, and disappearing again.

To make things clearer when we speak of Bauble, but should—and in this
document we will—indicate whether it's Bauble(the software), or Bauble(the
people), unless obviously we mean both things.

Mission
..............................................

Mission: To continuously develop Bauble ak GHINI as an open and free software for the documentation, research and management of biodiversity collections. The software is intended for organizations and educational institutions that have or manage for example botanical gardens, arboretums, herbaria, but also for people studying or working with such collections.
Furthermore, the openness of the software and the linkage online, enables the various users to contribute to the improvement of the software and sharing solutions, to enhance the availability and visibility of such biodiversity collections.

the mission is a purpose, it defines the rationale of an entity and
is specific and true. For Bauble, the Mission Statement sets out the social
order to which Bauble is committed, the needs that are satisfied with
Bauble(the software) and with the services of Bauble(the people), the market
in which Bauble develops and its intended public image.
