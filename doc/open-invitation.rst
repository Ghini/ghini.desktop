Dear conservator, dear scientist,

You are reading Ghini's presentation letter.  Ghini is a github free software project, focusing on botany.
Ghini is brought to you by a small community of coders, botanists, translators, and is supported by a few
botanical gardens around the world, which have adopted it and are using it for all their collection
management needs.

Ghini is a complete software solution:

- Ghini's core, **ghini.desktop**, lets you enter and correct your data, navigate its links, produce
  reports, import and or export using several standard or ad-hoc formats, review your taxonomy using
  online sources, all according the best practices suggested by top gardens and formalized in standard
  formats like ABCD, ITF2, but also as elaborated by our developers, based on the feedback by Ghini users.
  **ghini.desktop** is developed and continously tested on GNU/Linux, but it runs equally well on Windows,
  or OSX. [1]

- Within Ghini, **ghini.pocket** is your garden companion.  Ghini.pocket is an Android app you install
  from the Play Store, and it assists you in collectingm or correcting, data while in the field, lets you
  associate pictures to your plants, and verify taxonomic information.

- **ghini.web** is a web server and a courtesy service, offering you world wide visibility: you export a
  selection of your data from your desktop database, and offer it for publication to the Ghini project,
  and we will include it at http://gardens.ghini.me/, at no cost while we're able to do that, or for a
  guaranteed minimal time if you are able to support our hosting costs.

  **ghini.web** serves a map with gardens, and georeferenced plants.  it also serves information panels,
   for the use of the most recent Ghini family member.

- **ghini.tour** is a 

Let me please add a few words about "Software made a Commons": With free software you get not only the
sources, you receive the right to adapt the code, and the invitation to share it, both share forward to
colleagues, and share back to the source.  With proprietary software, you buy dependency.

With free software you can still ask any local provider you have over there, to alter the software
according to your wishes, and please do this on github, fork the code, develop just as openly as I'm doing
now, and whenever you want, open a pull request so your edits can be included in the main line.  With free
software you acquire freedom and earn visibility: your additions stays yours, and you share them back to
the community, and will see them made better by others.
  




Dear Garden Conservator

Ghini is a small family of standalone programs, data servers and handheld clients, all dedicated to
helping gardens manage their collection, and to publishing it:

ghini.web is a public data serving hub both for ghini.tour instances, and for web clients exploring
participating gardens and checking presence of plant species.  ghini.web is still very experimental, I
need gardens expressing wishes, helping me formalize requirements, offering support while we reach a first
milestone. [3]

ghini.tour, also downloadable from the play store, is still in an a similar exploratory phase as
ghini.web.  at the very least, you can already use as a limited but decent map viewer. [4]

Ghini is "Copylefted" software, distributed under the GPL (Gnu Public License).  You can simply download
and use, or you can ask me for assistance.  You can also contribute to the software by helping me
translate into a few more slavic languages, starting with Serbocroatian. [5] I'm interested in hearing
from you, even if just to hear "we already have a software solution", and I'm curious which one.  I
publish some videos on youtube, highlighting some of the software capabilities. [6]

Thanks for your consideration; please let me know if you have any questions,

Mario Frasca MSc

as mentioned in the subject, I consider software a commons (something
that all can freely use, and nobody can enclose and make proprietary),
rather than an economic asset (something you can't possibly share with
others, without giving up what you have).

I'm Mario Frasca and I am the current maintainer of Ghini, a suite of software programs licensed according to the GNU Public License.  Can I assume you are acquainted with this License?  In short, the GPL translates the ethical scientific need to share knowledge into legal terms: its goal is to make ideas, also in the form of software, available to the wider public, and to prevent future appropriation of any derived work.

good morning,

I'm trying to get in contact with people within the council of botanic
gardens, who could be open for examining a proposal.  I am the current
maintainer of the free software Ghini, for the management of botanic
collections.  the proposal is very simple: could you introduce me to one
of the gardens in your area, who's looking for a strong data management
system, and has more time than money?  my advantage would be to have
more feedback (and a Russian translation), yours would be to evaluate a
software which you could further help develop (shared advantage) and
keep in house.

ghini software is software made a commons, meaning you can freely copy
it, you can learn from it, you may enhance it, but you can't appropriate
it.  this is radically different than software as distributed by
commercial companies, where copying is not just discouraged but straight
away prohibited.



Dear James, good morning, and good morning Peter!

this is Mario Frasca of the Ghini Organization, Peter knows me, James
might have heard of me from colleagues who were at the regional
conferences in Panamá and Cuba.  In Panama I presented Ghini in person,
in Cuba I sent the attached panel.  I'm not a botanist, just a
mathematician with a specialization in information science, and as Peter
already knows I endorse the view of software as a commons, rather than
software as an economic asset.  I am trying to find my way inside the
mobot, and get in touch with the ones who take decisions about the
licensing of the software you develop.  it would be such a big advantage
to all, if it was copylefted, and published.  I would be happy to
contribute to its development and spreading.

unfortunately most institutions consider software an investment, not to
be shared with others, as if it was an economic good that can't be
duplicated, like gold.  as of now, I am aware of the existence of very
few copylefted programs for botanic data management:

* ghini.desktop, born as bauble.classic and made a Commons by the Belize
Botanical Garden.  (more recently bauble regressed to 2008, chose for a
different license, which makes it free but not copylefted, and is
stagnating).  ghini.desktop has three more components, a pocket data
collecting android app, a nodejs web server aggregating data from
different gardens and presenting it geographically, again a geographic
tour app aimed at visitors and using the web data aggregator as its data
source.  you find every Ghini component on github: http://github.com/Ghini

* specify 6 and 7, made a Commons by the Kansas University.  a bit
complex to set up, and very difficult to configure, tricky to update. 
the institutions I've met who tried it, only the bigger ones, with
in-house software management capabilities manage to successfully use it.
Specify is also on github: https://github.com/specify

* botalista, a French/Swiss cooperation, is GPL as far as I know, but it
wasn't yet released for public download.

* Taxasoft-BG, from Eric Gouda, a Dutch botanist, specialist in
Bromeliaceae, collection manager at the Utrecht botanical garden. it was
me who convinced him to publish what he was doing, and to publish it
under the GPL, but I'm afraid he never posted any update of what he's
been doing after 2016, April 13th and I'm also afraid he forgot to
clearly specify the license.  I know that he actively works at it and at
its distribution.  you find it on github:
https://github.com/Ejgouda/Taxasoft-BG

of the above, only ghini.desktop satisfies the conditions: copylefted,
available, documented, maintained, easy to install and configure. 
moreover: cross platform, internationalized.

maybe you can add to the list?  or even: your decision makers could add
your own system?  Peter, what's your opinion in this?

friendly regards,

Mario Frasca




good day Nick Baker and staff,

some time ago you Nick wrote to the bauble google forum, thanking the
authors of Bauble "for the privilege of using" that little piece of
software.  I'm not sure if you're still using it, and I hope so, and
suggest you should want to upgrade to the latest version of the same
software.  I have brought development under a different name: Ghini, in
honour to Luca Ghini, founder of the first botanical garden in Europe,
and I've broadened the family with a hand held inventory reviewing tool,
a data aggregator which I'm running as a service at
http://gardens.ghini.me/, and a hand held app for garden visitors.

As it was for Bauble, Ghini is all under the strictly free licence GPL,
while ghini.web follows the even more radically free AGPL.

I'm attaching a poster I sent to Cuba, for the recently held regional
conference (Caribbean and Central America).

In case you're interested to publish your tree collection on the net, I
would be happy to include your plants, species, coordinates to
http://gardens.ghini.me.  Georeferenced textual information panels, also
very welcome, all offered as courtesy: we're still defining the offer. 
The idea behind this is allowing visitors explore aggregated gardens
collections, and it focuses as of now on trees.

a small example is : http://gardens.ghini.me/#garden=Jardín%20el%20Cuchubo

best regards,

Mario Frasca
