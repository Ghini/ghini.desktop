Dear conservator, dear scientist,

Ghini is a copylefted libre software project for botany.
Brought to you by a small community of coders, botanists, translators, and supported by
botanical gardens around the world, for all their collection management needs.

As a complete software solution of standalone programs, data servers and handheld clients, Ghini is
dedicated to helping gardens manage and publish their collection:

- **ghini.desktop**, is the core of Ghini, and it allows entering and correcting data, navigating links, producing
  reports, import and or exporting several standard or ad-hoc formats, reviewing your taxonomy using
  online sources. All according to best practices suggested by top gardens and formalized in standard
  formats, like ABCD or ITF2, but also as elaborated by our developers, based on the feedback by Ghini users.
  Developed and continously tested on GNU/Linux, but runs equally well on Windows, or macOS. [1]

- **ghini.pocket** is your garden companion within Ghini. An Android app you can install
  from F-Droid or the Play Store, it assists you in collecting or correcting data while in the field,
  associating pictures to your plants, and verifying taxonomic info.

- **ghini.web** is a web server and a courtesy service, offering you world wide visibility: Export a
  selection of your data from your desktop database, and offer it for publication to the Ghini project,
  for inclusion on http://gardens.ghini.me/, 
  
  **ghini.web** serves a map with gardens, and georeferenced plantsm and info panels.

- **ghini.tour** assists visitors by offering a map with spoken virtual panels.

With libre software you get the source code, the right to adapt the code, and the invitation to share it, both with colleagues, back to the source, or make your own. As opposed to proprietary software, you do not buy dependency.

Anyone can alter the software according to your wishes, even make their own product, and doing so is already fascilitated on GitHub. Fork the code, develop it any direction you want, even sending pull requests so your edits can be included in the main branch. With libre software you acquire freedom and earn visibility: Your additions stays yours, and you share them back to the community, potentially made better by others.
  




Dear Garden Conservator

ghini.web is a public data serving hub both for ghini.tour instances, and for web clients exploring
participating gardens and checking presence of plant species. ghini.web is still very experimental, gardens are encouraged to express wishes, which helps formalize requirements, offering support while reaching a first
milestone. [3]

ghini.tour, also downloadable from F-Droid, or the Play store, in a similarly exploratory phase,
though one can already make use of the limited but decent map viewer. [4]

Ghini is "copylefted" software, distributed under the GPL (GNU Public License). This means changes have to be shared back, so that everyone can enjoy all the freedoms offered. Download and use it, or ask for assistance doing so. Right now it needs translations for a few more slavic languages, starting with Serbocroatian. [5] Even if you already have a software solution, do send a reply detailing which one and what you think of it. Some videos are published on YouTube, highlighting some of the software capabilities of Ghini. [6]

Thanks for your consideration; please let me know if you have any questions,

Mario Frasca MSc

as mentioned in the subject, I consider software a commons (something
that all can freely use, and nobody can enclose and make proprietary),
rather than an economic asset (something you can't possibly share with
others, without giving up what you have).
Even additional services such as ghini.web is offered at no cost in this vein, or for a guaranteed minimal time if you are able to support the costs of hosting.

I'm Mario Frasca, the current maintainer of Ghini, a suite of software programs licensed according to the GNU Public License. In short, the GPL translates the ethical scientific need to share knowledge into legal terms: Its goal is to make ideas, also in the form of software, available to the wider public, and to prevent future appropriation of any derived work.

good morning,

I'm trying to get in contact with people within the council of botanic
gardens, who could be open for examining a proposal. I am the current
maintainer of the free software Ghini, for the management of botanic
collections. Could you introduce me to one of the gardens in your area,
that are looking for a strong data management system, even ones with
more time than money? My advantage is increased feedback (and a Russian translation),
This evaluation of the software can be expanded to further help develop
it, for your and our use.

The Ghini software is software made into a commons, meaning you can freely copy
it, learn from it, and you may enhance it, but you can't appropriate
it. This is different from closed software, where copying is not just
discouraged but strictly prohibited.


Dear James, good morning, and good morning Peter!

this is Mario Frasca, of the Ghini Organization, Peter knows me, James
might have heard of me from colleagues who were at the regional
conferences in Panama, where I presented Ghini, and Cuba, where i sent the
attached panel. I'm not a botanist, just a mathematician specializing 
in information science, and as Peter already knows I endorse the view
of software as a commons, rather than just an economic asset.
I am trying to find my way inside the mobot, and get in touch with
the licensing devision makers of the software you develop.
It would be a big advantage to all, if it was copylefted, and published.
I would be happy to contribute to its development help its outreach.

Unfortunately most institutions consider software an investment, not to
be shared with others, as if it was an economic good that can't be
duplicated, like gold. As of now, I am aware of the existence of very
few copylefted programs for botanic data management:

* ghini.desktop, born as bauble.classic and made a Commons by the Belize
Botanical Garden.  (more recently Bauble regressed to 2008, chose for a
different license, which makes it free but not copylefted, and it is
stagnating). ghini.desktop has three more components, a pocket data
collecting Android app, a nodeJS web server, aggregating data from
different gardens, and presenting it geographically, again a geographic
tour app aimed at visitors and using the web data aggregator as its data
source.  Every Ghini component is on GitHub: http://github.com/Ghini

* specify 6 and 7, made a Commons by the Kansas University. A bit
complex to set up, and very difficult to configure, tricky to update. 
the institutions I've met who tried it, only the bigger ones, with
in-house software management capabilities manage to successfully use it.
Specify is also on GitHub: https://github.com/specify

* botalista, a French/Swiss cooperation, is GPL as far as I know, but it
wasn't yet released for public download.

* Taxasoft-BG, from Eric Gouda, a Dutch botanist, specialist in
Bromeliaceae, collection manager at the Utrecht botanical garden. it was
me who convinced him to publish what he was doing, and to publish it
under the GPL, but I'm afraid he never posted any update of what he's
been doing after 2016, April 13th and I'm also afraid he forgot to
clearly specify the license.  I know that he actively works at it and at
its distribution. You can find it on GitHub:
https://github.com/Ejgouda/Taxasoft-BG

Of the above, only ghini.desktop satisfies the conditions: Copylefted,
available, documented, maintained, easy to install and configure. 
moreover: Cross platform, internationalized.

Maybe you can add to the list?  Or your decision makers could even add
your own system? Peter, what's your opinion in this?

Friendly regards,

Mario Frasca




Good day Nick Baker and staff,

some time ago you Nick wrote to the Bauble Google forum, thanking the
authors of Bauble "for the privilege of using" that little piece of
software.  I'm not sure if you're still using it, and I hope so, and
suggest you should want to upgrade to the latest version of the same
software. I have brought development under a different name: Ghini, in
honour of Luca Ghini, founder of the first botanical garden in Europe.
I've broadened the family with a hand-held inventory reviewing tool,
a data aggregator, which I'm running as a service at
http://gardens.ghini.me/, and a hand-held app for garden visitors.

As with Bauble, Ghini is all under the libre licence GPL,
while ghini.web follows the even more free AGPL.

Attached you will find a poster I sent to Cuba, for the recently held regional
conference (Caribbean and Central America).

In case you're interested in publishing your tree collection on the Internet, I
would be happy to include your plants, species, and coordinates on
http://gardens.ghini.me  Georeferenced textual info panels, also
very welcome, are all offered as a courtesy: We are still defining the offer. 
The idea behind this is allowing visitors to explore aggregated garden
collections, and as of now it focuses on trees.

A small example: http://gardens.ghini.me/#garden=Jard√≠n%20el%20Cuchubo

Best regards,

Mario Frasca
