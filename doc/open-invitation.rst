Dear conservator, dear scientist,

You are reading Ghini's presentation letter.  Ghini is a github free software project, focusing on botany.
Ghini is brought to you by a small community of coders, botanists, translators, and is supported by a few
institutions around the world, among which the gardens that have adopted it for all their collection
management needs.

The Ghini family is a software suite of standalone programs, data servers and handheld clients, all
dedicated to helping gardens manage their collection, and to publishing it.
The Ghini family is a complete software solution

* Ghini's core, ``ghini.desktop``, lets you enter and correct your data, navigate its links, produce
  reports, import and or export using several standard or ad-hoc formats, review your taxonomy using
  online sources, all according the best practices suggested by top gardens and formalized in standard
  formats like ABCD, ITF2, but also as elaborated by our developers, based on the feedback by Ghini users.
  ``ghini.desktop`` is developed and continously tested on GNU/Linux, but it runs equally well on Windows,
  or OSX. [1]
* Within Ghini, ``ghini.pocket`` is your garden companion.  ``Ghini.pocket`` is an Android app you install
  from the Play Store, and it assists you in collectingm or correcting, data while in the field, lets you
  associate pictures to your plants, and verify taxonomic information.
* ``ghini.web`` is a web server and a courtesy data hub service.  ``ghini.web`` offers you world wide
  visibility: you export a selection of your data from your desktop database, and handle it for
  publication to the Ghini project, and we will include it at http://gardens.ghini.me/, at no cost while
  we're able to do that, or for a guaranteed minimal amount of time if you are able to support our hosting
  costs.  ``ghini.web`` serves a world map to help locate participating gardens, and within each garden,
  its contributed georeferenced plants.  it also serves information panels, for the use of the most recent
  Ghini family member: ``ghini.tour``.
* ``ghini.tour`` is a geographic tour Android app aimed at visitors, it uses OpenStreetMap as base map and
  retrieves its data from the web data aggregator.

All software withing the Ghini family is licensed according to the GNU Public License.  Can I assume you
are acquainted with this License?  In short, the GPL translates the ethical scientific need to share
knowledge into legal terms: its goal is to make ideas, also in the form of software, available to the
wider public, and to prevent future appropriation of any derived work.  If you want to read more about it,
please refer to https://www.gnu.org/licenses/copyleft.html

Ghini's idea about knowledge ownership is that software should be made a "commons": With software made a
commons, "free software", you get not only the sources, you receive the right to adapt the code, and the
invitation to share it, both share forward to colleagues, and share back to the source.  With proprietary
software, you are buying your own dependency.

With free software you can still ask any local provider you have over there, to alter the software
according to your wishes, and please do this on github, fork the code, develop just as openly as I'm doing
now, and whenever you want, open a pull request so your edits can be included in the main line.  With free
software you acquire freedom and earn visibility: your additions stays yours, and you share them back to
the community, and will see them made better by others.



Ghini is "Copylefted" software, distributed under the GPL (Gnu Public License).  You can simply download
and use, or you can ask me for assistance.  You can also contribute to the software by helping me
translate into a few more slavic languages, starting with Serbocroatian. [5] I'm interested in hearing
from you, even if just to hear "we already have a software solution", and I'm curious which one.  I
publish some videos on youtube, highlighting some of the software capabilities. [6]

Thanks for your consideration; please let me know if you have any questions,

Mario Frasca MSc

as mentioned in the subject, I consider software a commons (something
that all can freely use, and nobody can enclose and make proprietary),
rather than an economic asset (something you can't possibly share with
others, without giving up what you have).



I'm trying to get in contact with people within the council of botanic
gardens, who could be open for examining a proposal.  I am the current
maintainer of the free software Ghini, for the management of botanic
collections.  The proposal is very simple: could you introduce me to one
of the gardens in your area, who's looking for a strong data management
system, and has more time than money?  My advantage would be to have
more feedback (and a Russian translation), yours would be to evaluate a
software which you could further help develop (shared advantage) and
keep in house.

Ghini software is software made a commons, meaning you can freely copy
it, you can learn from it, you may enhance it, but you can't appropriate
it.  This is radically different than software as distributed by
commercial companies, where copying is not just discouraged but straight
away prohibited.



This is Mario Frasca of the Ghini Organization, Peter knows me, James might have heard of me from
colleagues who were at the regional conferences in Panamá and Cuba.  In Panama I presented Ghini in
person, in Cuba I sent the attached panel.  I'm not a botanist, just a mathematician with a specialization
in information science, and as Peter already knows I endorse the view of software as a commons, rather
than software as an economic asset.  I am trying to find my way inside the mobot, and get in touch with
the ones who take decisions about the licensing of the software you develop.  it would be such a big
advantage to all, if it was copylefted, and published.  I would be happy to contribute to its development
and spreading.

Unfortunately most institutions consider software an investment, not to be shared with others, as if it
was an economic good that can't be duplicated, like gold.  As of now, I am aware of the existence of very
few copylefted programs for botanic data management:

* ``ghini.desktop``, born as bauble.classic and made a Commons by the Belize Botanical Garden.  (More recently
  bauble regressed to 2008, chose for a different license, which makes it free but not copylefted, and is
  stagnating).  ``ghini.desktop`` has three more components, a pocket data collecting android app, a nodejs
  web server aggregating data from different gardens and presenting it geographically, again a geographic
  tour app aimed at visitors and using the web data aggregator as its data source.  You find every Ghini
  component on github: http://github.com/Ghini

* Specify 6 and 7, made a Commons by the Kansas University.  A bit complex to set up, and very difficult
  to configure, tricky to update.  The institutions I've met who tried it, only the bigger ones, with
  in-house software management capabilities manage to successfully use it.  Specify is also on github:
  https://github.com/specify

* Botalista, a French/Swiss cooperation, is GPL as far as I know, but it wasn't yet released for public
  download.

* Taxasoft-BG, from Eric Gouda, a Dutch botanist, specialist in Bromeliaceae, collection manager at the
  Utrecht botanical garden. it was me who convinced him to publish what he was doing, and to publish it
  under the GPL, but I'm afraid he never posted any update of what he's been doing after 2016, April 13th
  and I'm also afraid he forgot to clearly specify the license.  I know that he actively works at it and
  at its distribution.  You find it on github: https://github.com/Ejgouda/Taxasoft-BG

Of the above, only ``ghini.desktop`` satisfies the conditions: copylefted,
available, documented, maintained, easy to install and configure.
Moreover: cross platform, internationalized.

Maybe you can add to the list?  Or even: your decision makers could add
your own system?  Peter, what's your opinion in this?

Friendly regards,

Mario Frasca




some time ago you Nick wrote to the bauble google forum, thanking the
authors of Bauble "for the privilege of using" that little piece of
software.  I'm not sure if you're still using it, and I hope so, and
suggest you should want to upgrade to the latest version of the same
software.  I have brought development under a different name: Ghini, in
honour to Luca Ghini, founder of the first botanical garden in Europe,
and I've broadened the family with a hand held inventory reviewing tool,
a data aggregator which I'm running as a service at
http://gardens.ghini.me/, and a hand held app for garden visitors.

As it was for Bauble, Ghini is all under the strictly free licence GPL,
while ``ghini.web`` follows the even more radically free AGPL.

I'm attaching a poster I sent to Cuba, for the recently held regional
conference (Caribbean and Central America).

In case you're interested to publish your tree collection on the net, I
would be happy to include your plants, species, coordinates to
http://gardens.ghini.me.  Georeferenced textual information panels, also
very welcome, all offered as courtesy: we're still defining the offer.
The idea behind this is allowing visitors explore aggregated gardens
collections, and it focuses as of now on trees.

a small example is : http://gardens.ghini.me/#garden=Jardín%20el%20Cuchubo

best regards,

Mario Frasca
