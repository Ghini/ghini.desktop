subject: Welcome to Ghini/Bauble

Dear new user,

Welcome to Ghini/Bauble.

As the maintainer, I have received your registration for bauble.classic/ghini.desktop,
many thanks for taking your time to fill in the form.

I see you are using bauble.classic-1.0.55, whereas 1.0.55 is the last released version of bauble.classic, however,
bauble.classic is now unmaintained and superseded by the fully compatible, but slightly aesthetically different ghini.desktop. Install it following the instructions found at http://ghini.rtfd.io

The registration service says you're not yet using the newest Python2 version available. As of 2018-05-01, that is 2.7.15. Using any older version does not necessitate problems, but in case anything strange happens, please update your Python (and PyGTK) before reporting any errors.

Also thank you for enabling the "sentry" errors and warnings handler.
With that enabled, Ghini/Bauble will send any error or warning you might encounter to a central server, where a developer will be able to examine it. If the warning was caused by an error in the software, its solution will be present in a subsequent release of the software

If you haven't already, to enable the sentry and warnings handler, open the ":config" page in Ghini and double click on the row "bauble.use_sentry_client".

I hope Ghini already matches your expectations,
if this is not the case, the whole Ghini community would be very thankful
if you took the time to report your experience with it.

The above is one way to contribute to Ghini's development. Others are:
- contribute ideas, writing on the bauble google forum (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bauble),
- contribute documentation, or translations (https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/ghini/),
- give private feedback, writing to ghini@anche.no,
- rate and discuss Ghini openly, and promote its adoption by other institutions,
- open an issue on GitHub (https://github.com/Ghini/ghini.desktop/issues/),
- contribute code on GitHub (fork the project on (https://github.com/Ghini/ghini.desktop/),
- hire a developer and have a set of GitHub issues solved, per-haps your own
- let me include your garden on the still experimental worldmap (http://gardens.ghini.me)

I sincerely hope you will enjoy using this copylefted, libre software

Best regards,
Mario Frasca
