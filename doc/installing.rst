Installation
============

ghini.desktop is a cross-platform program and it will run on unix machines
like GNU/Linux and MacOSX, as well as on Windows.

.. admonition:: one-liner for hurried users.
   :class: note

           Linux users just download and run `the installation script
           <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ghini/ghini.desktop/ghini-1.0/scripts/devinstall.sh>`_.
           You may read the documentation later.

           Windows users, start downloading all external dependencies (`git
           <Direct link to download git_>`_, `Python <Direct link to
           download Python_>`_, `lxml <Direct link to download lxml_>`_,
           `PyGTK <Direct link to download PyGTK_>`_, `psycopg2 <Direct link
           to download psycopg2_>`_), read the instructions in the
           meanwhile.

           Mac users are never in a hurry, are they?

Ghini is maintained by very few people, who focus on enhancing its
functional parts, more than on writing fancy installers. Instead of several
native installers we offer a single cross-platform installation procedure.
This has a few big advantages which you will learn to appreciate as we go.

The installation is based on running a script.

* The GNU/Linux script takes care of everything, from dependecies to
  installation for users in the ``ghini`` group.
* The Windows script needs you to first install a couple things.
* On MacOSX we use the same script as on GNU/Linux. Since OSX has no default
  package manager, we install one and we use it before we start the script.

Following our installation procedure, you will end with Ghini running within
a Python virtual environment, all Python dependencies installed locally, non
conflicting with any other Python program you may have on your system.

Dependencies that don't fit in a Python virtual environment are: Python,
virtualenv, GTK+, and PyGTK. Their installation varies per platform.

If you later choose to remove Ghini, you simply remove the virtual
environment, which is a directory, with all of its content.

Installing on GNU/Linux
--------------------------

Open a shell terminal window, and follow the following instructions.

#. Download the `devinstall.sh` script:

     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ghini/ghini.desktop/ghini-1.0-dev/scripts/devinstall.sh

#. Invoke the script from a terminal window, starting at the directory where
   you downloaded it, like this::

     bash ./devinstall.sh

   The script will produce quite some output, which you can safely ignore.

   .. admonition:: global installation
      :class: note

              When almost ready, the installation script will ask you for
              your password.  This lets it create a ``ghini`` user group,
              initialise it to just yourself, make the just created
              ``ghini`` script available to the whole ``ghini`` user group.

              If feeling paranoid, you can safely not give your password and
              interrupt the script there.

              Possibly the main advantage of a global installation is being
              able to find Ghini in the application menus of your graphic
              environment.

#. You can now start ghini by invoking the ``ghini`` script::

     ghini

   #. You use the same ``ghini`` script to update ghini to the latest
      released production patch::

        ~/bin/ghini -u

      This is what you would do when ghini shows you something like this:

      .. image:: images/new_version_available.png

   #. Users of the global installation will also type ``ghini`` to invoke
      the program, but they will get to a different script, located in
      ``/usr/local/bin``. This globally available ``ghini`` script cannot be
      used to update a ghini installation.

   #. Again the same ``ghini`` script lets you install the optional database
      connectors: option ``-p`` is for PostgreSQL, option ``-m`` is for
      MySQL/MariaDB, but you can also install both at the same time::

        ~/bin/ghini -pm

      Please beware: you might need solve dependencies. How to do so,
      depends on which GNU/Linux flavour you are using. Check with your
      distribution documentation.

   #. You can also use the ``ghini`` script to switch to a different production
      line.  At the moment ``1.0`` is the stable one, but you can select
      ``1.1`` if you want to help us with its development::

        ~/bin/ghini -s 1.1

.. admonition:: beginner's note
   :class: note

           To run a script, first make sure you note down the name of the
           directory to which you have downloaded the script, then you open
           a terminal window and in that window you type `bash` followed by
           a space and the complete name of the script including directory
           name, and hit on the enter key.

.. admonition:: technical note
   :class: note

      You can study the script to see what steps if runs for you.

      In short it will install dependencies which can't be satisfied in a
      virtual environment, then it will create a virtual environment named
      ``ghide``, use git to download the sources to a directory named
      ``~/Local/github/Ghini/ghini.desktop``, and connect this git checkout
      to the ``ghini-1.0`` branch (this you can consider a production line),
      it then builds ghini, downloading all remaining dependencies in the
      virtual environment, and finally it creates the ``ghini`` startup script.

      If you have ``sudo`` permissions, it will be placed in
      ``/usr/local/bin``, otherwise in your ``~/bin`` folder.

Installing on MacOSX
--------------------

Being MacOSX a unix environment, most things will work the same as on GNU/Linux
(sort of).

Last time we tested, some of the dependencies could not be installed on
MacOSX 10.5 and we assume similar problems would also show on older OSX
versions.  Ghini has been successfully installed on several OSX systems,
between 10.7 and 10.12.

First of all, you need things which are an integral part of a unix
environment, but which are missing in a off-the-shelf mac:

#. developers tools: xcode. check the wikipedia page for the version
   supported on your mac.
#. package manager: homebrew (tigerbrew for older OSX versions).

with the above installed, open a terminal window and run::

    brew doctor

make sure you understand the problems it reports, and correct them. pygtk
will need xquartz and brew will not solve the dependency
automatically. either install xquartz using brew or the way you prefer::

    brew install Caskroom/cask/xquartz

then install the remaining dependencies::

    brew install git
    brew install pygtk  # takes time and installs all dependencies

follow all instructions on how to activate what you have installed.

In particular, make sure you read and understand all reports starting with
``If you need to have this software``.

You will need at least the following four lines in your ``~/.bash_profile``::

  export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
  export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
  export PATH="/usr/local/opt/gettext/bin:$PATH"
  export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin:$PATH"

Activate the profile by sourcing it::

  . ~/.bash_profile

Before we can run ``devinstall.sh`` as on GNU/Linux, we still
need installing a couple of python packages, globally. Do this::

  sudo -H pip install virtualenv lxml

The rest is just as on a normal unix machine. Read the above GNU/Linux instructions, follow them, enjoy.

As an optional aesthetical step, consider packaging your ``~/bin/ghini``
script in a `platypus <https://github.com/sveinbjornt/Platypus>`_
application bundle.  The ``images`` directory contains a 128Ã—128 icon.

Installing on Windows
---------------------

The steps described here instruct you on how to install Git, Gtk, Python,
and the python database connectors. With this environment correctly set up,
the Ghini installation procedure runs as on GNU/Linux. The concluding steps are
again Windows specific.

.. note:: Ghini has been tested with and is known to work on W-XP, W-7 up to
   W-10. Although it should work fine on other versions Windows it has not
   been thoroughly tested.

The installation steps on Windows:

#. download and install ``git`` (comes with a unix-like ``sh`` and includes
   ``vi``). Grab it from `the Git download area <https://git-scm.com/download/win>`_.

   all default options are fine, except we need git to be executable from
   the command prompt:

   .. image:: images/screenshots/git3.png

#. download and install Python 2.x (32bit). Grab it from the `Python
   official site <http://www.python.org>`_.

   When installing Python, do put Python in the PATH:

   .. image:: images/screenshots/python3.png

#. download ``pygtk`` from `the official source
   <http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygtk/>`_. (this requires
   32bit python). be sure you download the "all in one" version.

   Make a complete install, selecting everything:

   .. image:: images/screenshots/pygtk1.png

#. (Possibly necessary, maybe superfluous) install lxml, you can grab this
   from `the pypi archives <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml/3.4.4>`_

   Remember you need the 32 bit version, for Python 2.7.

   .. note
      On some systems, lxml was necessary to avoid the following error::

        Building without Cython.
        ERROR: 'xslt-config' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
        operable program or batch file.

      If you skip this step and can confirm you get the error, please inform us.

#. (definitely optional) download and install a database connector other than
   ``sqlite3``.

   If you plan using PostgreSQL, the best Windows binary library for Python is
   `psycopg and is Made in Italy <http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/install.html>`_.
   

#. **REBOOT**

   hey, this is Windows, you need to reboot for changes to take effect!

#. We're done with the dependecies, now we can download and run the batch file:

   `devinstall.bat <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ghini/ghini.desktop/ghini-1.0-dev/scripts/devinstall.bat>`_

   Please don't just follow the above link.  Instead: right click, save link as...

   .. image:: images/windows-save_link_as.png

   Also make sure you don't let Windows convert the script to a text document.

   .. image:: images/windows-save_as_type.png

   Now **Open** the script to run it.  Please note: in the below image, we
   have saved the file twice, once letting Windows convert it to a text
   document, and again as a Windows Batch File.  Opening the batch file will
   run the script.  Opening the text document will show you the code of the
   batch file, which isn't going to lead us anywhere.

   .. image:: images/windows-bat_vs_txt.png

   If you installed everything as described here, the first thing you should
   see when you start the installation script is a window like this, and
   your computer will be busy during a couple of minutes, showing you what
   it is doing.

   .. image:: images/screenshots/sys32cmd-1.png

   Running ``devinstall.bat`` will pull the ``ghini.desktop`` repository from
   github to your home directory, under ``Local\github\Ghini``, checkout the
   ``ghini-1.0`` production line, create a virtual environment and install
   ghini into it.

   You can also run ``devinstall.bat`` passing it as argument the numerical
   part of the production line you want to follow.

   This is the last installation step that depends, heavily, on a working
   internet connection.

   The operation can take several minutes to complete, depending on the
   speed of your internet connection.

#. the last installation step creates the Ghini group and shortcuts in the
   Windows Start Menu, for all users. To do so, you need run a script with
   administrative rights. The script is called ``devinstall-finalize.bat``,
   it is right in your HOME folder, and has been created at the previous
   step.

   .. image:: images/windows-run_as_administrator.png

   Right-click on it, select run as administrator, confirm you want it to
   make changes to your computer.  These changes are in the Start Menu only:
   create the Ghini group, place the Ghini shortcut.

#. download the batch file you will use to stay up-to-date with the
   production line you chose to follow:

    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ghini/ghini.desktop/master/scripts/ghini-update.bat

   if you are on a recent Ghini installation, each time you start the
   program, Ghini will check on the development site and alert you of any
   newer ghini release within your chosen production line.

   any time you want to update your installation, just start the command
   prompt and run ``ghini-update.bat``, it will hardly take one minute.

If you would like to generate and print PDF reports using Ghini's default
report generator then you will need to download and install `Apache FOP
<http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/>`_.  After extracting the FOP archive
you will need to include the directory you extracted to in your PATH.
