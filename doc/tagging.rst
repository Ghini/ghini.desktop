Tagging
-------

Tagging is an easy way to give context to an object or create a collection
of object that you want to recall later.

The power in this tagging action is that you can share this selection with
colleagues, who can act on it, without the need to redo all your collecting
work.

For example if you need to print accession labels of otherwise unrelated
plants, you can group the objects by tagging them with the string
"relabel". You or one of your colleagues can then select "relabel" from the
tags menu, the search view will show all the objects you tagged, and
performing a report will act on the tagged objects.

Tagging acts on the active selection, that is the items in the search
results which you have selected.

Please remember: you can select all result rows by pressing Ctrl-A, you can
deselect everything by pressing Ctrl-Shift-A, you can toggle tagging of a
single row by Ctrl-Mouse clicking on it.

Once you have an active selection, tagging can be done in two ways:

dialog box tagging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Press Ctrl-T or select :menuselection:`Tag-->Tag Selection` from the menu,
this activates a window where you can create new tags and apply any existing
tag to the selection.

The tag window is composed of three parts:

# The upper part mentions the list of objects in your active selection. This
  is the list of object of which you are editing the tags;

# The middle part has a list of all available tags, with a checkbox that you
  can activate for applying the tag to or removing the tag from the
  selection;

# The lower part only holds a link to new tag creation, and the Ok button
  for closing the dialog box.

If, when opening the tag dialog box, the active selection holds multiple
items, then only the tags that are common to all the selected items will
have a check next to it.  Tags that only apply to a proper subset of the
active selection will show with an 'undecided' status.  Tags that don't
apply to any object in the active selection will show blank.

The most recently created tag, or the most recently selected tag becomes the
active tag, and it shows with a check next to it in the tags menu.

Once you have an active tag, pressing Ctrl-Y applies the active tag to all
objects in the active selection.  Ctrl-Shift-Y removes the active tag from
all objects in the active selection.
