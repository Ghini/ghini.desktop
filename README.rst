what is Ghini (desktop)
------------------------

Ghini was born as Bauble at the Belize Botanic Gardens, At its heart it is a
framework for creating database applications.  In their distributed form
Bauble and Ghini are applications to manage plant records and specifically
living collections.  Either as Ghini or Bauble, the software is used among
others by Belize Botanic Gardens, the Jardín Botánico de Quito, the Mackay
Regional Botanical Garden, to manage their live collections.  Included by
default is RBG Kew's Family and Genera list from Vascular Plant Families and
Genera compiled by R. K. Brummitt and published by the Royal Botanic
Gardens, Kew in 1992 used by permission from RBG Kew.

All code contained as part of the Bauble package is licenced under
the GNU GPLv2+.

Terms and Names
---------------

This file describes 'ghini.desktop', a standalone application. Until 2015
'ghini.desktop' was known as 'Bauble/bauble.classic'. Ghini and Bauble are
two github organizations. The current maintainer of Ghini forked development
from Bauble into Ghini mostly because of his difficulty in pronouncing
"bauble" and in explaining why the software was named that way.

Luca Ghini was the founder of the botanical garden of Pisa, and Pisa is the
place where the current maintainer Mario Frasca has completed his studies in
computer science.

Within the Ghini organization, you will find 'ghini.desktop', this program,
'ghini.pocket', a tiny android database viewer meant to help you take your
database in your pocket, 'ghini.github.io', the sources for the ghini
website, 'ghini.web', showcased at http://gardens.ghini.me, and ghini.tour,
a collection of settings for building audio guides to gardens.

The Ghini family has adopted two ODK products (`collect
<https://github.com/opendatakit/collect>`_ and `aggregate
<https://github.com/opendatakit/aggregate>`_), which help our users add or
correct information in the database.  Not part of the Ghini organization,
but integrated members of the Ghini family.

|ghini-family|

Just as Bauble's flagship was bauble.classic, Ghini's flagship is ghini.desktop.
