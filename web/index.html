      <h1>About Bauble</h1>
      <p>
	Bauble is a software application to help you (yes you) manage a 
	collection of biodiversity specimens. It is intended 
	to be used by botanic gardens, herbaria, arboreta, etc. to manage
	their collection information. It is a 
	<a href="http://opensource.org">open</a>, 
	<a href="http://www.fsf.org">free</a>, 
	cross-platform alternative to BG-Base and similiar software.
      </p>

      <h1>Goals</h1>
      
      <ul>
	<li>Intuitive - the interface for Bauble is designed to be simple 
	  and elegant but no less functional.</li>
	<li>Extensible - developers and institutions should be able to 
	  extend the application to customize it to their needs.</li>
	<li>Connected - ideally Bauble will easily access relevant 
	  information online, such as connecting to
	  <a href="http://www.gbif.org">GBIF</a> to look up information 
	  on a species.</li>
	<li>more, more, more...</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h1>Features</h1>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Bauble is free. Bauble is licensed under the 
	  <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a> 
	  which means you can download, distribute and change the source 
	  code for Bauble as long as the changes you make are also 
	  licensed under the 
	  <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a>.
	  This in no way affects the data you manage with Bauble.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Bauble is cross-platform. Bauble supports both Linux and 
	  Windows and could easily be ported to other platforms if 
	  there was interest. 
	</li>
	<li>
	  Bauble supports a wide variety of database backends. It has been 
	  tested using <a href="http://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a>, 
	  <a href="http://postgres.org">Postgres</a>, and
	  <a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a>. In theory it will work
	  with 
	  <a href="http://www.sybase.com">Sybase</a>, 
	  <a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org">Firebird/Interbase</a>, and 
	  <a href="http://www.mysql.com/products/maxdb/">SapDB/MaxDB</a>, 
	  Oracle and MSSQL.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Bauble can generate reports through an 
	  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xsl/">XSL</a> formatter backend.  
	  There is no fancy report designer but there is a GUI that allows
	  you to pass the results of a search through an XSL formatter. This
	  allows you to layout your data any way you wish and save it in a 
	  just about any format you can imagine including PDF, 
	  XML, or HTML.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Bauble is transaction safe. All database queries and updates are 
	  done through a transaction so any if you make a mistake while
	  editing a record you can easily back out of you mistakes.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Bauble can export data in CSV or Access to Biological Collection
	  Data (ABCD) format. In the future we hope to
	  support other standard formats such as ITF2, BioCASE, etc.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Bauble supports tagging.  You can tag any arbitrary data stored in
	  a Bauble managed database with arbitrary names. This way you can
	  create collections of records organized the way you want with names
	  you give them.
	</li>


      </ul>
      
      
      <h1>The future</h1>
      <p>
	Bauble will continue to become more reliable, secure and stable.  We 
	also plan to implement the following features sometime in the future.
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Because Bauble is being developed at 
	  <a href="http://www.belizebotanic.org">Belize Botanic Gardens</a> 
	  it's primary focus is towards botanical collections. With
	  help from others we would like to extend the scope of Bauble to 
	  handle other collection types that might be needed for herbaria,
	  zoos, arboreta, etc.
	</li>
	<li>
	  User rights - We plan on making it possible to define user and 
	  group permission on a Bauble database so that an administrator can
	  easily give different permission to individual users. e.g. Some 
	  people could change data while others could only view it.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Improve the tools - It would be nice to have a good collection of 
	  tools bundled with Bauble that can do a variety of things
	  such as create labels and reports, and ....
	</li>
	<li>
	  Other languages support - make it possible to translate Bauble into 
	  other languages with support for entering non-Latin characters
	</li>
	<li>
	  more...
	</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <ol>
	<li>
	  <strong>Why another collection manager application?</strong>
	  <br/>
	  At <a href="http://www.belizebotanic.org">Belize Botanic Gardens</a> 
	  we felt that the free collection management software was either too 
	  expensive, inadequate or only supported Windows so we decided to 
	  create our own.</li>
	<li>
	  <strong>But why for free?</strong>
	  <br/>
	  We feel that current collection management software is overpriced 
	  especially for small institutions in developing countries.  
	  Biodiversity affects our entire world and everything that relies on 
	  it to live. To help protect such a fragile system the management 
	  of information related to biodiversity should not be restricted.  
	</li>
	<li>
	  <strong>Why are there so many prerequisites for installing this 
	    software?</strong>
	  <br/>
	  On Linux, the platform where the software is developed and primarily 
	  used, the prerequisites tend to come preinstalled. It's more of a 
	  hassle for Windows users (but not much).  We assume that anyone 
	  setting up a new collection database is relatively computer savvy 
	  and that installing the prerequisites won't be too much trouble. In 
	  the future we may bundle SQLObject and an SQLite driver and connector
	  with the software so it works out of the box.</li>
